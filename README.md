# ProgrammingForAI Repository
This repository contains two projects focusing on data preprocessing for machine learning tasks. Each project employs a different programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques to solve distinct problems:

# SMS Spam Detection (C++)
Objective:
To preprocess SMS text data and detect spam messages using modular and reusable code designed with advanced OOP principles in C++.

Details:
-The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as ham (legitimate) and spam (unwanted or fraudulent).
-The goal is to preprocess this dataset by cleaning and normalizing the text to prepare it for analysis and classification.
-Advanced OOP techniques in C++ (such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation) are used to create reusable and efficient classes for text preprocessing.

# Image Preprocessing for Emotion Classification (Python)
Objective:
To preprocess face image data for emotion classification tasks, leveraging Python's dynamic OOP capabilities to create scalable and efficient pipelines.

Details:
-The dataset contains face images categorized into emotions: Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised.
-The preprocessing tasks include resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the dataset's quality for machine learning tasks.
-Python's flexible OOP principles (such as composition, inheritance, and abstraction) are applied to design modular preprocessing pipelines.
